# Loan Prediction Project

**Background**

With the growth of the finance industry, multifinance companies face challenges in evaluating the risks associated with lending. These risks can significantly impact the profitability of the company. Therefore, it is crucial to have an effective system to identify high-risk loans.

**Goal**

The main objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately identify loan risks. The project aims to create machine learning to predict whether a loan is **good** or **risky**. By employing various machine learning techniques, we aim to determine the best model that can assist multifinance companies in making better decisions.

**Business Understanding**

In the multifinance business, understanding the risks associated with lending is key to reducing financial losses and increasing profitability. By predicting loan risks, companies can:

- Reduce default rates.
- Set appropriate interest rates based on risk levels.
- Enhance customer satisfaction and trust by offering suitable products.

- **Logistic Regression** : if the logistic regression model is chosen in classifying good and risky loans, this data will consist of **90.166% good loans** and **9.834% risky loans**.
- **K-Nearest Neighbors** : if the knn model is selected in classifying good and risky loans, this data will consist of **83.601% good loans** and **16.399% risky loans**.
- **Random Forest** : if the random forest model is chosen in classifying good and risky loans, this data will consist of **82.719% good loans** and **17.281% risky loans**.
